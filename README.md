# 🔀 Random Startup Name Generator

This is a **simple JavaScript program** that randomly generates quirky and creative startup-style names by combining three categories of words.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

The script randomly selects one word each from the following categories:

- **First Word**: `"crazy"`, `"amazing"`, `"fire"`
- **Second Word**: `"engine"`, `"food"`, `"garment"`
- **Third Word**: `"bros"`, `"limited"`, `"hub"`

It uses `Math.random()` to determine which word from each category will be selected.
